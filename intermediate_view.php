						<b>Sofia:</b> Children! We have our private body parts that you should never let anyone touch.<br/>
							- They are: Lips, chest area, in between your legs and your bottom.<br/>
							- Your mom can when she is bathing you or your doctor can while checking on you when you are sick but no other person is allowed to touch.<br/>
							- In case one tries to you should always say “No” loudly and run away from there.<br/>
							- You should tell your parents about it and if they are not there, tell the person you trust the most.<br/>
							- Always remember it’s not your fault and we are always here for you.<br/>
							- Earlier when I said the person you trust they can be your parents, grandparents, teacher or your caretaker.<br/>
							- So, can any one of you tell me what are your private body parts that no one should touch?<br/>
